    Hello in this video we're going to take a look at how to get started with maple when you open up a maple document it's already en masse mode what you want to do is click on text mode this will allow you to write your name and the assignment number as you would normally do in a word or word processed talking now if you want to enter a mathematical expression there are many menus along the left hand side of the screen to open any fees click on the tab and you will see many symbols and operations available to you so for example if you wanted to write sat a which has the integers from zero to ten minutes you could simply write finally and similarly you could write me has the sad containing the integers negative one zero and one if you wanted to express union either a and B. you could simply click over here on the symbol for union and write the answer similarly for intersection you can click on intersection and proceed as follows now maple has a wonderful help menu and we'll take a look at that suppose we wanted to find the prime factorization other number and we typing prime factorization we don't find any matches and this is very common in people often you will need to refine your search term so let's look up factorization here we find a command called I factor and reading down through the description and the options for this command we find some sample code at the bottom and this looks reasonable this looks like what we wanted to do so let's try this in army people document someone to copy and paste the command and right now I'm in text mode but to get maple to actually perform some mathematical operations we wanna click onto math mode and maple did what I wanted to do now suppose he wanted to find the prime factorization of hundred twenty two or the prime factorization of thirty one you can perform it as follows now we are still in math mode to get back to text mode I just click on text or you can hit the control team there are times when we won and started drying into maple to do this we will go to insert campus from here you have a lot of tools to use lex click on the line by and what we're going to try here is the land is for the client for proof so I'm gonna start making a line and double click to end networking program another line double click to end the line and proceed as follows I leave a little space so that we can insert the names of the sub groups and I know these terms may not be familiar to you right now that's fine we will learn more about what those terms mean as we proceed in her purse but the shows the basic set up of how to insert the campus now let's say we want to put some text into are crying we click on the text button click where we want the text of the and we can click the for their similarly we can hang again and get it her text over here and you can click and drag these things around so that the I. trying looks very nice okay well that is the conclusion of this video thank you for watching.
